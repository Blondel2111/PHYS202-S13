Using the wood saxon parameters from the paper, determine the elements we need to use for possible collisions. Up to naturally 
forming, stable elements up to Cf.

Add side view of colliding particles (see arxiv example).

Future Work: 
keep track of colide1/2 arrays to choose which event you are seeing.
Keeps a maximum of 50 arrays of the collision positions
