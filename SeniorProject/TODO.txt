TODO:

Add line that connects average value of ncoll/npart for each slice of constant b 
values in plot of ncoll/npart vs. b.

Fit parameters change each year due to new data?

google 'inelastic cross section pp'. Look for values not in pdg or durham. Totem compilation.
EPL96 21002 (7pp) IOP website. Add inelastic values to plot for comparison. Separate data to know
the reference for each point. Include legend. 

Future Work: 

Plot graph on processing time vs N for N=1,10,100,1000,10000.

keep track of colide1/2 arrays to choose which events to plot.

Keeps a maximum of 50 arrays of the collision data to conserve memory.

support for colliding different nuclei. Test case He-3 on Au-197 @ 200GeV.
