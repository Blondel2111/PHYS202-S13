TODO:

Write methods of functions that write arrays to data files, comment lines that include information about how data was created.
Particles, energy, number of runs, density parameters and function, and sigI.
Saves data with timestamp as part of save file to prevent overriding old data.
ex. AuHe3_200Gev_04Apr2014_09-09.DAT
-Iterate through lines, writing each one to output file. At beginning of each new
array, write identifying line that can be read back in real time.

Mention changes that were made to improve the code. (Ex. addition of x,y, z columns. Does not
need to be in chronological order, etc.)

#Distribution for He3 by 
Mention alternative models for Charge density distribution that have not been implemented into code. Mention what we use to distribute helium instead.

Future Work: 

Test case He-3 on Au-197 @ 200GeV. Au+Au @ 200 GeV. Pb+Pb at 2.76 TeV. For paper.
