Research: Cern root package for fFunction->get random
How does this code sample and distribute nucleons and how does it compare to our distrube1D?

Add side view of colliding particles (see arxiv example).

Future Work: 

keep track of colide1/2 arrays to choose which event you are seeing.

Keeps a maximum of 50 arrays of the collision positions

Build particles in 3d, check to see if particles overlap. If they do, get new values til they dont overlap
If nucleons physically overlap (Hardcore collision) they cannot collide with any other nucleons
